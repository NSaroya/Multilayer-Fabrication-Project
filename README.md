The project was undertaken as a component of ECE 457, focusing on Microfabrication and Devices, within the nanoFAB - Fabrication and Characterization Facility - located in Edmonton.

# Objective
This project aimed to fabricate a variety of multilayer devices and test structures using conventional fabrication techniques for integrated circuits such as spin coating, photoresist baking, photolithography, and mask alignment. The devices and test structures were inspected and tested at intermediate points and when they were complete. The project utilized three
patterned layers to produce a variety of test structures, photonic structures, and electronic devices including some simple circuits.

#  Process flow overview
The first patterned layer (bottom layer) and third patterned layer (top layer) are aluminum (metal; electrically conductive). This second patterned layer (middle layer) is silicon nitride, which is electrically insulating.

This three-layer structure is sufficient for making a variety of devices while allowing for the wiring formed by lines of aluminum in the bottom and top layers to cross laterally (in the x-y plane). Each of the layers will be patterned using standard microfabrication techniques. The substrate used is a silicon wafer. However, as the Si wafer is itself semiconducting, devices fabricated on the wafer need to be electrically isolated from one another. This is done by having a layer of silicon oxide (SiO2) between the Si wafer and the bottom Al layer.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Wafer preparation
The Si wafer (‚àº500 ¬µm) is cleaned using piranha solution before processing to remove any foreign materials that might be on the surface.
### Step 2 ‚Äî Grow insulating layer of SiO2
A thin layer of SiO2(‚àº300 nm) is ‚Äúgrown‚Äù by a process called thermal oxidation. An alternate method would be to use plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), but thermal oxidation is more efficient.
### Step 3 ‚Äî Deposit aluminum
Al metal (‚àº100 nm) is sputtered onto the surface of the Si wafer.
### Step 4 ‚Äî Lithography: Apply resist
A layer of UV-sensitive material called photoresist is spin-coated onto the surface of the aluminum.
### Step 5 ‚Äî Lithography: Align and expose
A patterned mask (metal pattern on glass) is brought into contact with the photoresist. The photoresist is exposed to UV light, through the mask. Areas covered by metal on the mask are protected, while uncovered areas are exposed to the UV light. The UV light exposure changes the chemical composition of the photoresist in the exposed areas.
### Step 6 ‚Äî Lithography: Develop
The wafer is then placed in a developer solution that removes the resist in the regions where it has been exposed to the UV light.
### Step 7 ‚Äî Etching
The photoresist acts as a protective layer and the Al is etched away until the underlying SiO2 layer is reached.
### Step 8 ‚Äî Resist removal
The remaining photoresist is stripped with acetone leaving the wafer with a patterned aluminum layer.

Steps 3 through 8 are repeated twice with slight variations to deposit and pattern the silicon nitride (middle layer) and the top aluminum layer. Removal of material by etching and deposition of a subsequent layer of material (Step 3 in the next cycle) allows the top and bottom Al layers to come into contact with each other at different places across the wafer.

# Experimental Setup

**Session #1:** The aim of this session was to pattern the first (bottom) aluminum layer. Before the session, the preparation steps of wafer cleaning, thermal oxidation of silicon oxide layer, and sputtering of metal layer 1 had been completed. The wafer cleaning process is done using piranha etch solution which is a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide in 3:1 ratio. The silicon wafer is first bathed in piranha solution for 15 minutes, followed by a 2-minute bath in
buffered oxide etch (BOE). Next, the SiO2 layer is deposited by thermal oxidation, followed by DC sputter deposition to deposit thin film of aluminum, roughly 100 nm, onto the surface of the substrate.

The final wafer layers consist of silicon base (~500 Œºùëö), insulating silicon dioxide layer (~300 ùëõùëö) and bottom layer (85.05 nm).

**Session #2:** A 150 nm silicon nitride insulator layer was deposited using PECVD, maintaining low temperatures to preserve film properties. The wafer was then treated with HMDS for enhanced photoresist adhesion. AZ 1512 photoresist was applied using the same process as session 1. After alignment on an ABM mask aligner, the photoresist was developed, resulting in a thickness of 1315 nm. The nitride layer, initially measured at 156.99 nm, was dry etched using Trion RIE equipment for 100s at an etch rate of 0.145 nm/s. Post-etch, the photoresist was removed using acetone, IPA, DI rinse, and N2 dry, yielding a final nitride thickness of 145.6 nm.

**Session #3:** The Al layer was sputtered, and we conducted photolithography and aluminum etching to pattern the topmost aluminum metal layer. Employing the AZ 1512 spin coating and baking process, a photoresist layer was applied. UV exposure for 2 seconds at an intensity of 75mJ/cm2 was followed by a 1 minute and 53 seconds development in AZ 400k 1:4 developer solution. After inspecting the features under a microscope, aluminum underwent wet etching in Al etchant for 6 minutes and 43 seconds. Following another inspection and satisfaction with feature appearance, the photoresist was removed with acetone and IPA. The final aluminum layer thickness measured 150.7 nm.
