# Objective
This project aimed to fabricate a variety of multilayer devices and test structures using conventional fabrication techniques for integrated circuits such as spin coating, photoresist baking, photolithography, and mask alignment. The devices and test structures were inspected and tested at intermediate points and when they were complete. The project utilized three
patterned layers to produce a variety of test structures, photonic structures, and electronic devices including some simple circuits.
#  Process flow overview
The first patterned layer (bottom layer) and third patterned layer (top layer) are aluminum (metal; electrically conductive). This second patterned layer (middle layer) is silicon nitride, which is electrically insulating.

This three-layer structure is sufficient for making a variety of devices while allowing for the wiring formed by lines of aluminum in the bottom and top layers to cross laterally (in the x-y plane). Each of the layers will be patterned using standard microfabrication techniques. The substrate used is a silicon wafer. However, as the Si wafer is itself semiconducting, devices fabricated on the wafer need to be electrically isolated from one another. This is done by having a layer of silicon oxide (SiO2) between the Si wafer and the bottom Al layer.

## Step 1 — Wafer preparation
The Si wafer (∼500 µm) is cleaned using piranha solution before processing to remove any foreign materials that might be on the surface.
## Step 2 — Grow insulating layer of SiO2
A thin layer of SiO2(∼300 nm) is “grown” by a process called thermal oxidation. An alternate method would be to use plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), but thermal oxidation is more efficient.
## Step 3 — Deposit aluminum
Al metal (∼100 nm) is sputtered onto the surface of the Si wafer.
## Step 4 — Lithography: Apply resist
A layer of UV-sensitive material called photoresist is spin-coated onto the surface of the aluminum.
## Step 5 — Lithography: Align and expose
A patterned mask (metal pattern on glass) is brought into contact with the photoresist. The photoresist is exposed to UV light, through the mask. Areas covered by metal on the mask are protected, while uncovered areas are exposed to the UV light. The UV light exposure changes the chemical composition of the photoresist in the exposed areas.
## Step 6 — Lithography: Develop
The wafer is then placed in a developer solution that removes the resist in the regions where it has been exposed to the UV light.
## Step 7 — Etching
The photoresist acts as a protective layer and the Al is etched away until the underlying SiO2 layer is reached.
## Step 8 — Resist removal
The remaining photoresist is stripped with acetone leaving the wafer with a patterned aluminum layer.

Steps 3 through 8 are repeated twice with slight variations to deposit and pattern the silicon nitride (middle layer) and the top aluminum layer. Removal of material by etching and deposition of a subsequent layer of material (Step 3 in the next cycle) allows the top and bottom Al layers to come into contact with each other at different places across the wafer.
